- Use context7 tool to load documentation when needed
- Use modern Python (>=3.10) with up-to-date syntax and typing (list[str], | for unions, etc.).
- Write Google-style docstrings.
- Use one-line docstrings for simple methods; full docstrings otherwise.
- Prefer simple, straightforward solutions over complex or over-engineered ones.
