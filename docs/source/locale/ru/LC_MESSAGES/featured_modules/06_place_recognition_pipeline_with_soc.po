"A module that implements a neural network algorithm for searching a "

"You should start with initializing neural model "
":class:`opr.models.place_recognition.base.LateFusionModel` with the "
"image, cloud and SOC modules. The recommended way to do this is to use "
"the `configs/model/place_recognition/multimodal_with_soc_outdoor.yaml "
"<https://github.com/OPR-"
"Project/OpenPlaceRecognition/blob/main/configs/model/place_recognition/multimodal_with_soc_outdoor.yaml>`_"
" config file to instantiate the model with Hydra and load the weights "
"from the "
"``\"weights/place_recognition/multimodal_with_soc_outdoor_nclt.pth\"`` or"
" other file."

"Then you should initialize the "

":class:`opr.pipelines.registration.pointcloud.PointcloudRegistrationPipeline`."
