"You should start with initializing neural model "
":class:`opr.models.place_recognition.base.LateFusionModel` with the image"
" and cloud modules. The recommended way to do this is to use the "
"`configs/model/place_recognition/multi-image_lidar_late-fusion.yaml "
"<https://github.com/OPR-"
"Project/OpenPlaceRecognition/blob/main/configs/model/place_recognition"
"/multi-image_lidar_late-fusion.yaml>`_ config file to instantiate the "
"model with Hydra and load the weights from the "
"``\"weights/place_recognition/multi-image_lidar_late-fusion_nclt.pth\"`` "
"or other file."
