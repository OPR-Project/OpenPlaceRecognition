"You should start with initializing neural model "
":class:`opr.models.place_recognition.base.LateFusionModel` with the "
"image, semantic and cloud modules. The recommended way to do this is to "
"use the `configs/model/place_recognition/multi-image_multi-"
"semantic_lidar_late-fusion.yaml <https://github.com/OPR-"
"Project/OpenPlaceRecognition/blob/main/configs/model/place_recognition"
"/multi-image_multi-semantic_lidar_late-fusion.yaml>`_ config file to "
"instantiate the model with Hydra and load the weights from the "
"``\"weights/place_recognition/multi-image_multi-semantic_lidar_late-"
"fusion_nclt.pth\"`` or other file."
