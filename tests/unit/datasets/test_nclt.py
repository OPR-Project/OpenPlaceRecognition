"""Unit tests for NCLT dataset module.

This module contains unit tests for the NCLT dataset implementation
in src/opr/datasets/nclt.py, focusing on behavior with and without MinkowskiEngine.

Key test areas:
1. Module imports cleanly regardless of MinkowskiEngine availability
2. Dataset creation works with mocked file system
3. Pointcloud collation either works or fails gracefully with helpful errors
4. Non-pointcloud data processing works without MinkowskiEngine

Following TDD principles with behavior-focused tests that validate user-facing
functionality rather than implementation details.
